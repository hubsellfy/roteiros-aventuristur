# Quick Start

Get Roteiros Aventuristur running in under five minutes with a single Docker command.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running on your machine
- Port `3000` available (or choose a different host port)

## Run Roteiros Aventuristur

Generate an encryption key and start the container in one step:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name trek \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -v ./uploads:/app/uploads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  mauriceboe/trek:latest
```

**Flag breakdown:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-d` | Run in the background |
| `-p 3000:3000` | Map container port 3000 to host port 3000 |
| `-e ENCRYPTION_KEY=...` | At-rest encryption key for stored secrets |
| `-v ./data:/app/data` | Persist the database and secrets |
| `-v ./uploads:/app/uploads` | Persist uploaded files |
| `--restart unless-stopped` | Auto-restart on reboot |

**Why the encryption key?** Roteiros Aventuristur encrypts stored secrets (API keys, MFA seeds, OIDC credentials) using this key. If you skip it, Roteiros Aventuristur auto-generates one and saves it to `./data/.encryption_key`. Setting it explicitly means you control the key and can back it up separately. The key generated inline above never gets printed, but Roteiros Aventuristur writes it to `./data/.encryption_key` on first start, so `cat ./data/.encryption_key` gets it back when you want a copy elsewhere.

Generate a standalone key at any time:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Access Roteiros Aventuristur

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## First User

On first boot Roteiros Aventuristur automatically seeds an admin account before any user registers. The credentials depend on how you start the container:

- **With `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars set:** those values are used directly.
- **Without those env vars:** Roteiros Aventuristur creates the account with email `admin@trek.local`, username `admin`, and a randomly generated password. The credentials are printed to the container log — run `docker logs trek` to retrieve them.

You will be prompted to change the password on first login.

Once an admin has set up [OIDC / SSO](OIDC-SSO) or [Passkeys](Passkeys), the login page offers those ways in as well, next to the password form (*Sign in with* followed by the provider's name, or *Sign in with a passkey*).

**Moving an existing Roteiros Aventuristur?** Instead of setting up a new admin, start the new install with `RESTORE_FROM_BACKUP` pointing at a backup ZIP inside the container (for example `-e RESTORE_FROM_BACKUP=/app/data/backup.zip` with the file placed in `./data`). On that first start Roteiros Aventuristur restores the backup before any setup and creates no admin account; sign in with an account from the backup. See [Backups](Backups#restoring-on-a-new-install-before-setup).

> **Admin:** As admin you unlock the Admin Panel — user management, addon toggles, packing templates, backups, and API key configuration.
